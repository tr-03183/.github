# TR-03183

This is a GitHub organisation to support the development of BSI's (the [German Federal Office for Information Security](https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/)) Technical Guideline TR-03183 "Cyber Resilience Requirements for Manufacturers and Products", which comprises three parts.

The Technical Guideline BSI TR-03183 covers Cyber Resilience Requirements for Manufacturers and Products and supports requirements by the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

This Technical Guideline is intended as a collection of information and as guidance on specific aspects of the CRA, particularly for manufacturers who have not yet established proper IT security processes as a regular part of their product development and their products' vulnerability handling.

The CRA came into force in December 2024. Transitional periods are currently running until CRA's full implementation on 11 December 2027. Find out more about the CRA: https://www.bsi.bund.de/dok/cra-en

Part 1 "General Requirements" describes requirements for Manufacturers and Products on the basis of the articles and annexes of the CRA.

Part 2 "Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)" describes formal and technical requirements for Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs).

Part 3 “Vulnerability Reports and Notifications” describes the handling of vulnerability reports.
